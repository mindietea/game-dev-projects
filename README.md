## "Sword and Sorcery" | Virtual Reality RPG

Repository: https://github.com/mindietea/SwordAndSorcery

Created for CZ 4001: Virtual and Augmented Reality at Nanyang Technological University. Group class project. Created using Unity, VRToolkit, and SteamVR. My part in planning included creating the design doc for the game, scoping out the project, and checking up on team progress. I focused on programming monster behavior, animations, the health system, and menu controls. I also helped out with weapon pickups and dabbled in voice-acting.

"Sword and Sorcery" is VR game where a player can move around in an open area. The goal is to explore the world to obtain weapons, defeat some number of monsters, and finally vanquish the boss that appears. The player uses the VR controllers to pick up various weapons, suchc as classical swords and a staff that can shoot fireball projectiles. Skeleton monsters shamble after the player, evil mushrooms create a dangerous area of spores, and dynamite-strapped bunnies explode on impact.

## "Mindy's Room" | Global Game Jam 2019 Singapore

Repository: https://github.com/mindietea/Home

Created for the 2019 Global Game Jam 2019, in Singapore at Republic Polytechnic. The theme was "Home." The group consisted of me (as a programmer), another student programmer, and three artists. I really love point-and-click games, as well as games with customization-as-achievement, so we wanted to create a game that captured that spirit while having some action. I did a lot of the programming of a scrolling craft screen UI, resource system to purchase items, monster attacks, and player attacks.

"Mindy's Room" is part point-and-click game and part top-down brawler. In order to cozy up an empty home with new furniture and knick-knancks, Mindy must go adventuring to destroy hostile monsters for resources.
