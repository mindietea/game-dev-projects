# game-dev-projects
A listing of all my game dev-related projects. I primarily am a programmer for these projects. I also love designing the main concept/exact mechanics and organizing their production.

## "Awry" | GMTK Jam 2020 - #116 out of 5397

Created for GMTK Game Jam 2020 with the theme "Out of control."

"Awry" is a cute, lil bit goofy game where you must keep 4 RPG heroes from destroying each other when they become possessed by the Big Bad Final Boss.

## "Realm of the Lost Socks" | Global Game Jam 2020

Created for the Global Game Jam 2020 Austin site with the theme "Repair."

"Realm of the Lost Socks" is a local co-op rhythm game where you play as one of the sock fairies working to "re-pair" lost socks with their righful partner. Hectic, colorful, cute, and short! See how many points you can score with a friend, or try your hand at controlling both characters at once (spoiler: it's hard).

This game was made with love among a group of old and new friends. It's also a sentimental game for me, since it was my last game jam of college. I really wanted to try creating a co-op action rhythm game and it turned out to actually be a fun, challenging game to play. Not to mention super cute!

## "Return: Into Darkness" | UT Game Jam 2019 - Best Overall

Created for the UT Game Jam 2019 with the theme "Return." This was created with a group of students where I lead the design, directed art, and helped programmed the game.

"Return: Into Darkness" is a platformer in which the player must retrieve something from the end of the tunnel and return home. Darkness closes in periodically, and so the player must return to be safe at home when this happens. Venture out to gather resources to build power-ups that help you get further and further into the tunnel.

I really enjoyed creating the design concept for this game, and from my past jam experiences could scope it properly. We ended up making a pretty polished short game, with complete art assets, narrative, and even a tutorial.

## "Heritage" | Global Game Jam 2018 Austin - 1st Place Winner

Created for the Global Game Jam 2018 Austin site. The theme was "Transmission."

Recycle your life and keep improving to defeat an ancient evil. In "Heritage," you fight a monster that is much stronger you where you constantly die trying to defeat it. However, you pass on your power to a new heir with their own strengths and weaknesses generation after generation. Eventually, the collective power becomes great enough for you to defeat the bullet-hell beast.

I led design and storyboarding of the game. I also worked on programming the overall gameplay flow, UI, and player stats.

Made with Unity2D and C#.

## "Card Forge: Market Day" | Augmented Reality Semantic Card Game

Created for CZ 4001: Virtual and Augmented Reality at Nanyang Technological University. This was an individual project where I wanted to focus on using augmented reality to create an interesting design for a video game. The idea is that cards are something physical and satisfying, and it would be cool to augment the reality of cards with something magical. This game has you as a magical merchant satisfying the particular requests of customers-- maybe someone is hungry and wants a large meal, or needs something discreet to assassinate someone with. You satisfy these requests by combining cards that cast spells with cards that represent objects-- for example you might cast a "Maximize" spell on a "Ham" card to make a big ham and really make the hungry customer happy. The cards have objects on them and spells also augment the visual effects of the cards. The way your wares are scored is by semantics-- so several stats on the cards decide how well you fulfill the request, like "deadliness" or "grandeur." Spell cards can add modifiers to base stats, either by being multipliers or additions. There are also discrete tags on objects, like "edible" or "wearable" that are important to certain requests.

The small demo of this game I created made me think further about how a concept like this could be expanded-- it could be a good way to explore and teach semantics. It is also a game that allows for creative expression, which I would love to expand to a combat-based card game. Creating a good system to judge meaning is something I want to explore more, and expand into making more creatively expressive games.

This game was created with Vuforia in Unity. Check out a poor quality demo video here! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tn1yTRU-03WeeUBqo04o250Q4ivLTM4G/view?usp=sharing And a bonus technical demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tn1yTRU-03WeeUBqo04o250Q4ivLTM4G/view?usp=sharing

## "Sword and Sorcery" | Virtual Reality RPG

Repository: https://github.com/mindietea/SwordAndSorcery

Created for CZ 4001: Virtual and Augmented Reality at Nanyang Technological University. Group class project. Created using Unity, VRToolkit, and SteamVR. My part in planning included creating the design doc for the game, scoping out the project, and checking up on team progress. I focused on programming monster behavior, animations, the health system, and menu controls. I also helped out with weapon pickups and dabbled in voice-acting.

"Sword and Sorcery" is VR game where a player can move around in an open area. The goal is to explore the world to obtain weapons, defeat some number of monsters, and finally vanquish the boss that appears. The player uses the VR controllers to pick up various weapons, suchc as classical swords and a staff that can shoot fireball projectiles. Skeleton monsters shamble after the player, evil mushrooms create a dangerous area of spores, and dynamite-strapped bunnies explode on impact.

## "Mindy's Room" | Point-and-Click-and-Adventure | Global Game Jam 2019 Singapore

Repository: https://github.com/mindietea/Home

Created for the 2019 Global Game Jam 2019, in Singapore at Republic Polytechnic. The theme was "Home." The group consisted of me (as a programmer), another student programmer, and three artists. I really love point-and-click games, as well as games with customization-as-achievement, so we wanted to create a game that captured that spirit while having some action. I did a lot of the programming of a scrolling craft screen UI, resource system to purchase items, monster attacks, and player attacks. Made in Unity.

"Mindy's Room" is part point-and-click game and part top-down brawler. In order to cozy up an empty home with new furniture and knick-knancks, Mindy must go adventuring to destroy hostile monsters for resources.

## "Throwing Shaders" | 3D Slime Bonanza

Repository: https://github.com/mindietea/ShadersProject

Created for CS 354R: Game Technology at the University of Texas at Austin. Group class project using Unreal Engine. We wanted to create a game in Unreal Engine and create custom shaders that can be applied as materials to any mesh. I worked on the typing system for various slimes, weapon hitboxes, the health system, and the ice shader.

"Throwing Shaders" is a 3D demo where the player can pick up many different types of weapons with interesting looks to them. Slimes with varous types, like cel-shading, iciness, magma, cartoony water, etc. can be attacked to have them drop weapons that match them.

## Chicken Block | EGaDS Game Jam 2018
A simple platformer made in Unity. Reflect projectiles at enemies to fend them off.

## Nature Walk | OpenGL Demo

More of a technical graphics demonstration than game. A calm nature experience programmed using OpenGL and GLSL. The terrain is procedurally generated with Perlin noise. The user can move around the scene and also control the strength and direction of the wind that animates the grass. The water is shaded realistically with transparency and reflection of the skybox.

This project was a final project for Professor Vouga's Graphics Honors class (CS 378H) at UT Austin, where we were given the opportunity to propose our own project and implement it.

I worked on the wind animations, realistic water shading, and skyboxes.

Made with C++ and GLSL.

## FaceFeud | HackTX 2017

Repository: https://github.com/mindietea/FACEFEUD_HackTX

A web game that uses your face and emotions as a controller for a video game. Created for HackTX 2017.

This was a solo side project and quick implementation a fun idea I had for a game. The game will periodically capture an image of you from your laptop camera and send it to Microsoft's Emotion API for analysis. An angry face will create an attack, and a sad face will create a defense.

Made with Javascript and Microsoft's Emotion API.

## Lone | Writing + Game project

A narrative-focused game with deeply personal themes.

I wrote the narrative as well as the code, and worked with an artist and musician. Written for a writing class at the Nanyang Technological University during my study abroad in Singapore.

## Shroom Game | EGaDS Game Jam 2016
Point-and-click, grow mushrooms using spores collected from platformer levels. My first Unity game and first game in general.
