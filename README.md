## "Sword and Sorcery" | Virtual Reality RPG

Created for CZ 4001: Virtual and Augmented Reality at Nanyang Technological University. Group class project. Created using Unity, VRToolkit, and SteamVR. My part in planning included creating the design doc for the game, scoping out the project, and checking up on team progress. I focused on programming monster behavior, animations, the health system, and menu controls. I also helped out with weapon pickups and dabbled in voice-acting.

"Sword and Sorcery" is VR game where a player can move around in an open area. The goal is to explore the world to obtain weapons, defeat some number of monsters, and finally vanquish the boss that appears. The player uses the VR controllers to pick up various weapons, suchc as classical swords and a staff that can shoot fireball projectiles. Skeleton monsters shamble after the player, evil mushrooms create a dangerous area of spores, and dynamite-strapped bunnies explode on impact.
